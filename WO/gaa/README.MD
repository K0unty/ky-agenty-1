## Google Gemini CLI

1. Testibg out google gemini cli here

https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli

- Note this runs with npx and very very slow

Installation

```sh
npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

- Note you will use bunx and see if that works
- This CLI is very slow and not very good

```sh
bunx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
```

- This seems to be one time execution

Installing it globaly to run mutiple times

```sh
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini
```

Your bun method

```sh
bun install -g @google/gemini-cli
gemini
```

- In vscode its very bad, slow and is asking for paid tier

> Gemini CLI is useless, when trying ot use it with vscode abandon
