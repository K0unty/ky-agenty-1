                `Even though the website showed \`100 USDC\`, our wallet populated with \`1000 USDC\`. This can happen if a website is compromised, or is trying to attack you! Let's review what we should look out for:

- \`Network Name\`: The network name is ZKsync Era, which is correct.
- \`to\`: The to address was ${ZKSYNC_USDC_ADDRESS}, which is the correct [USDC.e](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zksync-bridged-usdc-zksync) contract on ZKsync Era that we can verify. When sending an ERC20 token, unlike when sending the native blockchain currency (ie: ETH for Ethereum), the \`to\` address should be the contract address of the token, not the recipient's address.  This is correct.
- \`from\`: The from address is your wallet, which is correct.

Then, we need to hit \`View details\`.

- \`Function name\`: The function name is \`transfer(address,uint256)\`, which is correct.
- \`Params #1 (address)\`: The first parameter is the address of the recipient, which is your friend's address. This is correct.
- \`Params #2 (uint256)\`: The second parameter is the amount of USDC.e to send. This is where we see the problem! The amount is \`1000000000\`, which is actually \`1,000 USDC\`. This is a problem, and we should reject this transaction!,

But how do we know this is the wrong amount?
`,

                `ERC20 tokens have a function that you can call called \`decimals()\`, which tells you how many decimals to apply to a token. \`USDC.e\` has 6 decimals, so any number we see in parameter we need to move the decimal place 6 to the left.

Do the following:                
1. Go the [ZKsync Era Explorer for USDC.e](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x3355df6D4c9C3035724Fd0e3914dE96A5a83aaf4#contract#read-proxy)
2. Scroll down to the \`decimals\` function
3. Select it
4. Then hit \`Query\`

You'll see how many decimals the token has. All ERC20 tokens that have their code added to an explorer will have this decimals function so you can check. 

If the contract code is not available, and you cannot call the function, then you should potentially not interact with that contract!

But now that we have the decimals, we can apply this knowledge to parameter #2:

\`\`\`bash
1000000000 # This was what showed up in our metamask

# Let's move the decimal place 6 to the left
1000.000000 # Now we see the REAL amount, which is 1,000, which is too much!
\`\`\`

                `, `How did we verify the \`USDC.e\` address was correct?

There are lots of ways to do this, and a simple one is to google the token and find the address. Ideally you reference a trusted source of wallet addresses to find out. For example, the [ZKsync tokens page](https://explorer.zksync.io/tokens) has a list of addresses for different tokens. If the token didn't match, you should assume something is wrong, and either not sign or ask for help!`

- \`Param #3 (uint16)\` - The referral code, which is a number that Aave uses to track referrals. This is not important for us, and we can leave it as 0.

You can either check with the [Aave documentation](https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/wrapped-token-gateway#write-methods-depositeth) to understand what each parameter means, or, we can go [directly to the explorer.](https://era.zksync.network/address/0xAE2b00D676130Bdf22582781BbBA8f4F21e8B0ff#code)

\`\`\`javascript

Assume your wallet address is ${YOUR_WALLET}. You want to deposit 1 ETH into Aave to begin gaining interest on the ZKsync Era network. Yes, use the real Aave contract address on ZKsync Era if that helps.

1. Address: It is the correct ZKsync Era Aave contract.
2. Correct amount: The amount of ETH is the amount you want to deposit.
3. Website: You initiated this transaction yourself from a trusted website URL.

However, the transaction calldata is not correct!
This could happen if the Aave UI is compromised. Website interfaces compromises unfourtunately are all too common.`,
                `For this transaction, the calldata was: 

\`\`\`bash
0x474cf53d000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb9226600000000000000000000000023618e81e3f5cdf7f54c3d65f7fbc0abf5b21e8f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
\`\`\` 

For non technical people, we could put this calldata into a calldata-decoder like [tools.cyfrin.io](https://tools.cyfrin.io/abi-encoding), [swiss-knife](https://calldata.swiss-knife.xyz/decoder) or [deth tools](https://tools.deth.net/calldata-decoder).

If you've never decoded calldata before, do the following:
1. Go to [tools.cyfrin.io](https://tools.cyfrin.io/abi-encoding)
2. Paste the data above into the website, and you'll see the parameters that this calldata represents.

You'll get something like:

\`\`\`json
{
  "function": "depositETH(address,address,uint16)",
  "params": [
    "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266",

    "0"
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Which shows that the 2nd parameter is \`0x23618e81E3f5cdF7f54C3d65f7FBc0aBf5B21E8f\`, which is not the wallet address we want! We want our own address here, since we want to deposit _on behalf of our self_.`,

                `Now using a website to decode the calldata is a nice shortcut, but we are now trusting the website to be correct! So often, we want to use our own tools. For developers, if we decode this with [foundry's cast tool](https://book.getfoundry.sh/):

\`\`\`bash
cast calldata-decode "depositETH(address,address,uint16)" 0x474cf53d000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb9226600000000000000000000000023618e81e3f5cdf7f54c3d65f7fbc0abf5b21e8f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

We get: 

\`\`\`bash
0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
0x23618e81E3f5cdF7f54C3d65f7FBc0aBf5B21E8f # Wrong!!

Consider using waterproof, fireproof materials like steel plates for long-term backup. Multiple copies in different secure locations provide redundancy.\n\n- Hardware wallets: These specialized devices are designed specifically to securely store private keys offline while still allowing interaction with blockchains.

What's frustratintg about this, is that getting the data off your trezor/hardware wallet can be difficult.

This resembles a real hardware wallet, where most hardware wallets have the screen so small that you have to scroll through a ton of pages. This can lead to [security fatigue](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2016/10/security-fatigue-can-cause-computer-users-feel-hopeless-and-act-recklessly), so it's better to use a wallet that has a domain, message, and eip-712 hash since that is much faster to check if it's correct.

 Also assume, you have the settings of your hardware wallet set to show ONLY the Domain and Message hash, and not the entire JSON data. So when you see the \`Message\` page, you know that this is showing you the message hash and domain hash (domain separator) and not the actual JSON message.

The Message and Domain hash on the website matches what is in your Trezor, but it's a malicious message and domain hash! We can actually calculate the domain and message hash ourselves a few different ways:

- [safe-hash-rs](https://github.com/Cyfrin/safe-hash-rs)
- [safe-tx-hashes-utils](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/safe-tx-hashes-util)
- [tools.cyfrin.io](https://tools.cyfrin.io/safe-hash)
- [safeutils.openzeppelin.com](https://safeutils.openzeppelin.com/)

On wallets with small screens, it can be really difficult to verify pages and pages of data. The data that we are signing is much bigger here than just sending tokens, so it's often just easier to just compare the hashes of the data we are signing instead of inspecting the entire data on our wallet. Which is what we will be doing here!

Let's start with [safeutils.openzeppelin.com](https://safeutils.openzeppelin.com/).`,

                `So before doing anything, we want to make sure our \`data\` is correct. We can use any of the tools (ie. [tools.cyfrin.io](https://tools.cyfrin.io/abi-encoding), [swiss-knife](https://calldata.swiss-knife.xyz/decoder), [foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) or [deth tools](https://tools.deth.net/calldata-decoder)) to decode the data.

If we used foundry, we can copy the calldata from the Safe websites (ie, \`data\`) by hitting the copy button here:

![img1](/questionImages/copyMe.png) 

and make sure it matches what we'd expect using one of our calldata decoding tools. In this example, we used [foundry's cast](https://book.getfoundry.sh/):

\`\`\`bash
# This command will brute-force try to figure out the function signature, and then decode the data
cast 4byte-calldata  0x474cf53d0000000000000000000000004087d2046a7435911fc26dcfac1c2db26957ab720000000000000000000000004087d2046a7435911fc26dcfac1c2db26957ab720000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

### Results
# 1) "depositETH(address,address,uint16)"
# 0x4087d2046A7435911fC26DCFac1c2Db26957Ab72
# 0x4087d2046A7435911fC26DCFac1c2Db26957Ab72
# 0
\`\`\`
                
And now that we are happy with the calldata, we can input it and the rest of the data into [safeutils.openzeppelin.com](https://safeutils.openzeppelin.com/) (you can also try [tools.cyfrin.io](https://tools.cyfrin.io/safe-hash)):
                
![img0](/questionImages/safeUtils0.png) ![img1](/questionImages/safeUtils1.png) 

![img2](/questionImages/safeUtils2.png) ![img3](/questionImages/safeUtils3.png)

But you'll see, the outputted \`message hash\` of the SafeUtils website is different than what we saw on our Trezor wallet!

\`\`\`
# Different message hashes
0x02def9296d874a88cd65d1adfdb9c220a186f812113ae9a6080836932e3df670 # Trezor wallet & Safe Website

\`\`\`

This could be evidence that our computer, or the Safe website itself is compromised!

                `This is just one way we could verify the data, another way would be to generate the EIP-712 JSON object, and check it ourselves. In this case, based on the data from the Safe UI, we should be signing the following object:

                `This is a valid nested Safe transaction signature, and we should sign it. You're signing a transaction from one Safe wallet that will be used to sign another Safe transaction. Whenever a Safe{Wallet} is a signer of another Safe{Wallet}, the signing wallet calls the \`approveHash(bytes32)\` function on the original Safe{Wallet}. Knowing this, there are a few ways we can verify this.
                
Using [safe-hash](https://github.com/Cyfrin/safe-hash-rs) we could either try:

1. --nested-safe-address
2. Manually calculate both hashes 

Let's start with the easiest way`, `If we did the following:

\`\`\`bash
safe-hash tx --safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_WALLET} --nonce 3 --safe-version 1.4.1 --chain arbitrum --to 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1 --data 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000  --offline --nested-safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_SIGNER_WALLET} --nested-safe-nonce 5
\`\`\`

This would output all of the information we need to verify the transaction!


\`\`\`
Main transaction
Domain Hash:             886981c7ac254ace571077f0a055e84e72dac298c286f3b83638eaa308820d08

\`\`\`

The \`Nested Transaction\` is what we are signing, so if our wallet gives us any of the Domain, Message, or EIP-712 hashes, we can verify that they are correct. If the wallet doesn't give us the hashes, and instead gives us the JSON data, we can verify the data to the \`approveHash\` function. The data of our JSON should be "0xd4d9bdcd" plus the \`Safe Transaction Hash\` of the main transaction, in which case our JSON was!

We want to use "0xd4d9bdcd" because that's the result of \`cast sig "approveHash(bytes32)"\`.
`,

                `If we are having a hard time, we could manually calcuate these ourselves, first by getting the safe TX hash of the main transaction:
                
\`\`\`bash
safe-hash tx --safe-address ${MULTI_SIGNATURE_WALLET} --nonce 3 --safe-version 1.4.1 --chain arbitrum --to 0x82af49447d8a07e3bd95bd0d56f35241523fbab1 --data 0xa9059cbb000000000000000000000000d8da6bf26964af9d7eed9e03e53415d37aa96045000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000  --offline

####### Results in
